## Planning and Development

To guide the initial direction for this project, I created rough Figma mockups to set the layout of different elements. These underwent a few revisions which resulted in a final version, both are shown below.

Development took place over a week and a half, with a few hours working on it each day. I took special care to ensure that the website is responsive and will function properly across a variety of browsers and screen sizes.
